/**
 * Types are derived from the schema customization in gatsby-node.js
 * and generated by running `gatsby develop` after editing the schema.
 * These generated types are accessed on the Queries object in the global
 * namespace as in Queries.DataByIdQuery for a page query called DataByIdQuery.
 *
 * To ensure data safety and avoid excess non-null assertions,
 * derived non-nullable types are added here, and used in conjunction with
 * resolvers that ensure fields are present.
 *
 * After updating schema customization, run `gatsby develop` to regenerate types.
