At the Allen Institute for Cell Science we are committed to being of service to the larger scientific community. That includes making our data, tools and results accessible. However, large datasets are not useful if it's unclear what can be done with them. This site aims to bridge the gap between the data we release and the unanswered questions we think they can be used to answer.  

We hope that existing collaborators and new researchers alike will find this site useful. 

### How to use this site

#### 1. Find a project or question you're interested in pursuing 

The list of ideas can be filtered by topic or type. 

#### 2. Reach out to the contact person if you have questions 

#### 3. Collect your own results 

#### 4. Make your results public 

Depending on the project that may mean a micro-publication you co-author with Allen Institute Scientists, a part of your undergraduate thesis, or we may add the results to this site for other people to continue working on.
