  description: "You can filter and search content by key words. Once you find a
    project you are interested in pursing, select the contact button to access
    our contact information and to indicate you're working on the idea."
description: "This site contains ideas, questions, observations that our
  scientists have come up with in the process of collecting data. There are more
  ideas than we can ever pursue ourselves, and our hope is other researchers
  will be able to take these ideas and make new discoveries."

* **New idea/question:**  This is an idea for a project or research question that someone could use one of our datasets to investigate, but does not have any or
  (has very little) preliminary work done towards this project. 
* **Early dataset:** A dataset in progress, possibly not fully tested to the standards of our pipeline data, but has interesting features that we want to share. 
* **Observation:** Something we've seen in our data that may be an interesting jumping off point for a project, or could be corroborating data for a project in another model system. anyone.
