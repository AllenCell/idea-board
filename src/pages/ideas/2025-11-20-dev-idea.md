program: EMT

introduction: >
  Collective cell migration during EMT appears to be preceded by subtle
  remodeling of cell-cell junctions. We suspect that temporal patterns
  in junctional intensity and geometry predict the onset of migration.

preliminaryFindings:
  summary: >
    Preliminary segmentation and tracking suggest that junction "flickering"
    (rapid local changes in junction length and intensity) increases
    ~30–60 minutes before migration onset in a subset of fields of view.

    - softwareTool:
        name: JunctionTracker
        instructions: >
          Run the junction segmentation notebook on raw timelapse movies
          (see /notebooks/junction_segmentation.ipynb). Then execute the
          tracking workflow and export per-junction time series as CSV.

    - softwareTool:
        name: MigrationOnsetDetector
        instructions: >
          Provide a directory of per-junction CSV files. The tool fits
          a change-point model to identify junctional remodeling events
          and aligns them to migration onset.

nextSteps: |
  1. Expand analysis to all EMT datasets and stratify by treatment.
  2. Quantify robustness of the junction "flicker" signature across cell lines.
  3. Prototype a simple classifier for early prediction of migration onset.
  4. Share intermediate results with the EMT program for feedback.

concerns: >
  Potential overlap with planned EMT program manuscripts; need to confirm
  publication strategy with program leads before extensive external sharing.
