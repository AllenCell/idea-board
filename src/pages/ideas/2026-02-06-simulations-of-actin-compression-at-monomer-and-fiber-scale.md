  The dynamic bending and twisting of actin is critical for many cellular
  processes. There exist many efforts to model actin using spatial simulation
  methods that represent different spatiotemporal scales. However, each of these
  simulations methods may have limitations due to implementation and assumptions
  necessary for the simulated spatial scale.


  We propose to run simulations of single actin filament compression at monomer- and fiber-scales using the [ReaDDy](https://readdy.github.io/) and [Cytosim](https://gitlab.com/f-nedelec/cytosim) simulation engines, respectively, under different compression velocities. By comparing the results of these simulations, we can identify regimes in which simulator predictions are (or are not) consistent and guiding principles for future multi-scale, compositional model development.
